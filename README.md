## 📌 About the Project

**CuniApp** is a farm management web application designed to help breeders efficiently monitor and organize rabbit reproduction cycles.

Managing a rabbit farm manually is difficult:
- forgetting mating dates
- not knowing expected birth dates
- poor tracking of newborn rabbits
- confusion between males and females

This system digitizes the entire breeding workflow and provides a clear dashboard to track all activities.
